Zone Achievement Tracker
===========================

Zone Achievement Tracker automatically adds the achievement for
completing quests in your current zone to the objectives tracker.

For example, when you enter Deepholm, you’ll track the achievement
"Deep into Deepholm" (Complete 110 quests in Deepholm) and when you 
enter Krasarang Wilds, you’ll track the "Mighty Roamin' Krasaranger"
achievement (Complete the Krasarang Wilds storylines listed below).

Achievements you have already completed cannot be tracked. Achievements
for other zones will be removed from the tracker. If you’d prefer not to
track the Pandaria and Draenor zone achievements with their long lists
of storylines, type "/zat" to toggle them off (or back on).

Known Issues
---------------

Some zones (eg. Mount Hyjal) will sometimes display only the achievement
name, and not the criteria, if you have already completed that zone's
achievement on another character on the same account. This is a Blizzard
bug, and there is unfortunately nothing I can do other than wait for
Blizzard to fix it.


Feedback
-----------

Post a ticket on either download site, or a comment on WoWInterface.

If you are reporting a bug, please include directions I can follow to
reproduce the bug, whether it still happens when all other addons are
disabled, and the exact text of the related error message (if any) from
[Bugger](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23144-Bugger.html).
